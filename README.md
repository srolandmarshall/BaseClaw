# BaseClaw

Your fantasy baseball team, managed by AI.

BaseClaw is an MCP server that gives Claude full access to your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league — your roster, the waiver wire, Statcast data, trade analytics, and 113 tools to act on it all. Ask questions in plain English or let an autonomous agent run your team on autopilot.

## What It Does

> "Who should I pick up this week to help my batting average?"

Just ask. Claude pulls your roster, checks your weak categories, scores every free agent, and recommends the best pickup — with specific stat reasoning.

```
You: "Should I drop Player X for Player Y?"

Claude calls:
  1. yahoo_roster          → your current roster + intel overlays
  2. yahoo_category_check  → your weak/strong categories
  3. yahoo_value (X)       → Player X z-score breakdown
  4. yahoo_value (Y)       → Player Y z-score breakdown
  5. yahoo_category_simulate → projected category rank changes

Claude synthesizes all 5 results and gives you a recommendation
with specific category-level reasoning.
```

More things you can ask:
- "Is it worth trading Soto for two mid-tier pitchers?"
- "Set my lineup for today — bench anyone without a game"
- "Who are the best streaming pitchers for next week?"
- "Scout my opponent this week — where can I beat them?"

Or go fully autonomous. Connect to an agent orchestrator like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) and your team manages itself:
- Daily: auto-sets optimal lineups, checks injuries, handles IL moves
- Weekly: scouts your matchup opponent, finds waiver wire targets, identifies trade opportunities
- On schedule: cron jobs trigger the agent at times you choose — no manual interaction needed
- Smart decisions: the agent follows configurable rules — auto-executes safe moves (lineup optimization), reports risky ones (trades) for your approval

Claude decides which tools to call based on your question. Complex questions chain 3-8 tool calls. Simple lookups are a single call.

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the Hood</strong></summary>

1. **Yahoo Fantasy API** — Your roster, standings, matchups, free agents, transactions, and league settings come from Yahoo's OAuth API in real time. Every tool call fetches current data, not cached snapshots.

2. **Analytics engine** — Z-score valuations tuned to your league's stat categories, powered by consensus projections (Steamer + ZiPS + Depth Charts blended) auto-fetched from FanGraphs, with park factor adjustments, rest-of-season valuation tracking, and in-season blending of projections + live stats weighted by games played. Category gap analysis, punt strategy advisor, playoff path planner, trade package builder, FAAB bid recommendations, and a trade finder that scans every team for complementary deals.

3. **Player intelligence** — Every player surface is enriched with Statcast data (xwOBA, xERA, exit velocity, barrel rate, percentile rankings, pitch arsenal, batted ball profile), platoon splits (vs LHP/RHP), historical Statcast comparisons, arsenal change detection, recent trend splits (7/14/30 day), plate discipline metrics (FanGraphs), Reddit sentiment from r/fantasybaseball, and MLB transaction alerts. Expensive API calls are cached with configurable TTL. Before the season starts, Savant data automatically falls back to the prior year so intel surfaces stay populated during spring training.

4. **Browser automation** — Write operations (add, drop, trade, lineup changes) use Playwright to automate the Yahoo Fantasy website directly, since Yahoo's API no longer grants write scope to new developer apps. Read operations still use the fast OAuth API.

5. **Inline UI apps** — Tool results aren't just text. Nine Preact + Tailwind + Recharts HTML apps with 62 views render interactive tables, charts, radar plots, heatmaps, and dashboards directly inside Claude's response using MCP Apps (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`).

6. **Workflow tools for agents** — Eleven aggregated tools (`yahoo_morning_briefing`, `yahoo_game_day_manager`, `yahoo_trade_pipeline`, etc.) each combine 5-7+ individual API calls server-side and return concise, decision-ready output in a single tool call. Designed for autonomous agents that need to minimize token usage and tool call count — a full daily routine takes just 2-3 tool calls instead of 15+.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker and `docker compose`

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jweingardt12/baseclaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer pulls the Docker image, prompts for Yahoo API credentials, starts the container, runs OAuth discovery, and configures your MCP client. Or tell your OpenClaw agent: **"install github.com/jweingardt12/baseclaw"**

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong></summary>

**1. Get Yahoo API credentials** — Go to [developer.yahoo.com/apps/create](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create), create an app with **Fantasy Sports** read permissions and `oob` as the redirect URI.

**2. Configure and run:**

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY and YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET
mkdir -p config data
docker compose up -d
```

**3. Discover your league** — triggers Yahoo OAuth and finds your league/team IDs:

```bash
./yf discover
```

Copy the printed `LEAGUE_ID` and `TEAM_ID` into `.env`, then `docker compose up -d` to restart.

**4. Connect to Claude** — add to `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "baseclaw": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "baseclaw", "node", "/app/mcp-apps/dist/main.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Desktop config paths: **macOS** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` · **Windows** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude.ai (remote access)</strong></summary>

Claude.ai needs the server reachable over HTTPS. Set `MCP_SERVER_URL` and `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env`, put a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, Pangolin) in front of port 4951, and rebuild with `docker compose up -d`.

In Claude.ai: Settings > Integrations > Add MCP Server > enter `https://your-domain.com/mcp`. You'll be prompted for your password. The MCP server implements OAuth 2.1 — no third-party auth provider needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Write operations (optional)</strong></summary>

To let Claude make roster moves (add, drop, trade, set lineup), set `ENABLE_WRITE_OPS=true` in `.env`, rebuild, and set up a browser session:

```bash
./yf browser-login
```

Log into Yahoo in the browser that opens. The session saves to `config/yahoo_session.json` and lasts 2-4 weeks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Preview dashboard (optional)</strong></summary>

Set `ENABLE_PREVIEW=true` in `.env`, rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build`, then open `http://localhost:4951/preview`. Browse all UI views with mock or live data.

</details>

**Uninstall:** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jweingardt12/baseclaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall`

## Agent Orchestrators (OpenClaw)

Your team manages itself. Connect BaseClaw to an agent orchestrator and it becomes an autonomous fantasy GM — setting lineups every morning, monitoring injuries, scouting opponents, finding waiver pickups, and identifying trades, all on autopilot.

Any MCP-compatible orchestrator works (OpenClaw, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.). The examples below use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com).

### What the Agent Does

**Every morning (9am):** Calls `yahoo_morning_briefing` + `yahoo_auto_lineup` — gets the full picture (injuries, matchup scores, category strategy, waiver targets), optimizes your lineup, and executes critical moves (IL stints, pending trade responses). You get a 2-3 sentence summary.

**Pre-lock (10:30am):** Calls `yahoo_game_day_manager` — weather risks, late scratches, streaming recommendations. Last-minute adjustments before lineups lock.

**Monday (8am):** Calls `yahoo_league_landscape` + `yahoo_matchup_strategy` — standings, playoff projections, and a category-by-category game plan for this week's opponent.

**Tuesday (8pm):** Calls `yahoo_waiver_deadline_prep` — ranks candidates with FAAB bids and simulated category impact. Submits top claims automatically.

**Thursday (9am):** Calls `yahoo_streaming` — finds two-start pitchers and favorable matchups. Adds the best option if it helps.

**Saturday (9am):** Calls `yahoo_roster_health_check` — audits for injured starters not on IL, bust candidates, and off-day issues.

**Sunday (9pm):** Calls `yahoo_weekly_digest` — matchup result, standings movement, key performers. Produces a narrative recap.

**Monthly (1st):** Calls `yahoo_season_checkpoint` — rank, playoff probability, category trajectory, and trade targets.

### Decision Tiers

| Tier | Actions | Agent Behavior |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Auto-execute** | Lineup optimization, IL moves | Safe and idempotent — acts immediately |
| **Execute + report** | Waiver pickups, streaming adds, obvious drops | High-confidence — acts and tells you what it did |
| **Report + wait** | Trades, dropping starters, large FAAB bids | Recommends but waits for your approval |

Tiers are defined in `AGENTS.md` and customizable to your comfort level.

### Cron Schedule

All times Eastern, configurable in `openclaw-cron-examples.json`:

| Schedule | Task | Tools Called |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Daily 9am | Lineup + briefing | `yahoo_morning_briefing` + `yahoo_auto_lineup` |
| Daily 10:30am | Pre-lock check | `yahoo_game_day_manager` |
| Monday 8am | Matchup plan | `yahoo_league_landscape` + `yahoo_matchup_strategy` |
| Tuesday 8pm | Waiver deadline prep | `yahoo_waiver_deadline_prep` |
| Thursday 9am | Streaming check | `yahoo_streaming` |
| Saturday 9am | Roster audit | `yahoo_roster_health_check` |
| Sunday 9pm | Weekly digest | `yahoo_weekly_digest` |
| 1st of month 10am | Season checkpoint | `yahoo_season_checkpoint` |

### Workflow Tools

Eleven aggregated tools designed for autonomous agents. Each combines 5-7+ individual API calls server-side and returns decision-ready output in a single call. Available to all clients (Claude Code, Claude.ai, orchestrators). See the full list in [MCP Tools > Workflows](#mcp-tools).

<details>
<summary><strong>Setup with OpenClaw</strong></summary>

The one-command installer handles OpenClaw configuration automatically. To set it up manually:

```bash
docker compose up -d
cp openclaw-config.yaml /path/to/openclaw/config/
cp AGENTS.md /path/to/openclaw/config/
cp openclaw-cron-examples.json /path/to/openclaw/config/
```

Edit `openclaw-config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: fantasy-gm
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    persona: ./AGENTS.md
    mcp_servers:
      - name: baseclaw
        command: docker
        args: [exec, -i, baseclaw, node, /app/mcp-apps/dist/main.js, --stdio]
        env:
          ENABLE_WRITE_OPS: "true"
    schedules: ./openclaw-cron-examples.json
```

- **`persona: ./AGENTS.md`** — Agent persona with league strategy, daily/weekly routines, workflow tools, and decision tiers. Customize to adjust behavior.
- **`ENABLE_WRITE_OPS: "true"`** — Required for roster moves. Without it, the agent can only read and recommend.
- **`schedules`** — Cron job definitions. Edit times, timezone, or tasks in `openclaw-cron-examples.json`.

Start the agent:

```bash
openclaw start
```

Example cron job:

```json
{
  "name": "Daily lineup + morning briefing",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 9 * * *", "tz": "America/New_York" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Daily routine. Call yahoo_morning_briefing, then yahoo_auto_lineup. Execute any priority-1 action items. Report actions taken in 2-3 sentences."
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent Persona</strong></summary>

The `AGENTS.md` file defines the agent's identity and behavior:

- **League awareness** — Learns your format, team count, scoring categories, and roster rules on first session
- **Strategy principles** — Target close categories, concede lost causes, stream pitchers, monitor closers, trade from surplus
- **Season phases** — Early (build depth, stream aggressively), mid (trade for balance, buy low), late (playoff positioning)
- **Decision trees** — Injury response pipelines, trade search workflows, waiver deadline claim chains
- **FAAB management** — Budget pacing, bid philosophy, emergency reserves
- **Competitive intelligence** — Track rival activity, react to opponent moves, check standings before trades
- **Token efficiency** — Workflow tools over individual tools, concise reports

Customize `AGENTS.md` to adjust strategy, risk tolerance, or reporting style.

</details>

### Health Check

`GET /health` returns `{ ok: true, writes_enabled: bool }` — unauthenticated, for uptime monitoring.

    FanGraphs (projections)  ├── Claude.ai (remote)
    Baseball Savant (intel)  └── Agent orchestrators
                                 (OpenClaw, cron-scheduled)
```

- **Read operations**: Yahoo Fantasy OAuth API (fast, reliable)
- **Write operations**: Playwright browser automation against Yahoo Fantasy website
- **Valuations**: Consensus projections (Steamer + ZiPS + Depth Charts) auto-fetched from FanGraphs, park-factor adjusted, blended with live stats in-season (weighted by games played), z-scored against league categories, with rest-of-season tracking and projection disagreement detection
- **Intelligence**: Statcast data with SIERA (expected ERA), platoon splits, arsenal change detection, batted ball profiles, and historical comparison — all cached with configurable TTL
- **MCP Apps**: Inline HTML UIs (Preact + Tailwind + Recharts) rendered directly in Claude via `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`
- **Workflow tools**: 11 aggregated endpoints for autonomous agents — each combines 5-7+ API calls server-side to minimize token usage

**Built with:** [yahoo_fantasy_api](https://github.com/uberfastman/yahoo_fantasy_api) | [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) | [MLB-StatsAPI](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) | [MCP Apps (ext-apps)](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol/tree/main/packages/ext-apps) | [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
