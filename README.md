Fantasy Baseball MCP Server for Claude. Manage your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league through natural conversation or let an AI agent run it autonomously — optimize lineups, analyze trades, scout opponents, find waiver pickups, and make roster moves, all backed by real-time data and rendered in rich inline UIs. Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, and agent orchestrators like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) for fully hands-free team management.

**Built with:** [yahoo_fantasy_api](https://github.com/uberfastman/yahoo_fantasy_api) | [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) | [MLB-StatsAPI](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) | [MCP Apps (ext-apps)](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol/tree/main/packages/ext-apps) | [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) | [MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

## What It Does

This MCP server gives Claude direct access to your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league, real-time MLB data, and advanced analytics. Instead of switching between Yahoo's app, Baseball Savant, Reddit, and spreadsheets, you just talk to Claude — or let an AI agent handle it all automatically.

**Two ways to use it:**

**Conversational** — Ask Claude directly:
- "Who should I pick up this week to help my batting average?"
- "Is it worth trading Soto for two mid-tier pitchers?"
- "Set my lineup for today — bench anyone without a game"
- "Who are the best streaming pitchers for next week?"

**Autonomous** — Connect to an agent orchestrator like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) and your team manages itself:
- Daily: auto-sets optimal lineups, checks injuries, handles IL moves
- Weekly: scouts your matchup opponent, finds waiver wire targets, identifies trade opportunities
- On schedule: cron jobs trigger the agent at times you choose — no manual interaction needed
- Smart decisions: the agent follows configurable rules — auto-executes safe moves (lineup optimization), reports risky ones (trades) for your approval

### How It Works

Claude calls the MCP tools to pull live data, run analysis, and take action on your behalf. Behind the scenes:

1. **Yahoo Fantasy API** — Your roster, standings, matchups, free agents, transactions, and league settings come from Yahoo's OAuth API in real time. Every tool call fetches current data, not cached snapshots.

2. **Analytics engine** — Z-score valuations tuned to your league's stat categories, powered by consensus projections (Steamer + ZiPS + Depth Charts blended) auto-fetched from FanGraphs, with park factor adjustments, rest-of-season valuation tracking, and in-season blending of projections + live stats weighted by games played. Category gap analysis, punt strategy advisor, playoff path planner, trade package builder, FAAB bid recommendations, and a trade finder that scans every team for complementary deals.

3. **Player intelligence** — Every player surface is enriched with Statcast data (xwOBA, xERA, exit velocity, barrel rate, percentile rankings, pitch arsenal, batted ball profile), platoon splits (vs LHP/RHP), historical Statcast comparisons, arsenal change detection, recent trend splits (7/14/30 day), plate discipline metrics (FanGraphs), Reddit sentiment from r/fantasybaseball, and MLB transaction alerts. Expensive API calls are cached with configurable TTL. Before the season starts, Savant data automatically falls back to the prior year so intel surfaces stay populated during spring training.

4. **Browser automation** — Write operations (add, drop, trade, lineup changes) use Playwright to automate the Yahoo Fantasy website directly, since Yahoo's API no longer grants write scope to new developer apps. Read operations still use the fast OAuth API.

5. **Inline UI apps** — Tool results aren't just text. Nine Preact + Tailwind + Recharts HTML apps with 62 views render interactive tables, charts, radar plots, heatmaps, and dashboards directly inside Claude's response using MCP Apps (`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`).

6. **Workflow tools for agents** — Six aggregated tools (`yahoo_morning_briefing`, `yahoo_league_landscape`, etc.) each combine 5-7+ individual API calls server-side and return concise, decision-ready output in a single tool call. Designed for autonomous agents that need to minimize token usage and tool call count — a full daily routine takes just 2-3 tool calls instead of 15+.

### Data Flow

When you ask Claude a question, here's what happens:

```
You: "Should I drop Player X for Player Y?"

Claude calls:
  1. yahoo_roster          → your current roster + intel overlays
  2. yahoo_category_check  → your weak/strong categories
  3. yahoo_value (X)       → Player X z-score breakdown
  4. yahoo_value (Y)       → Player Y z-score breakdown
  5. yahoo_category_simulate → projected category rank changes

Claude synthesizes all 5 results and gives you a recommendation
with specific category-level reasoning.
```

Claude decides which tools to call and in what order based on your question. Complex questions may chain 3-8 tool calls. Simple lookups ("show my roster") are a single call.

## Quick Start

### One-command install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jweingardt12/fbb-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or tell your OpenClaw agent: **"install github.com/jweingardt12/fbb-mcp"**

The installer handles everything: pulls the Docker image, prompts for your Yahoo API credentials, starts the container, runs Yahoo OAuth discovery, and configures your MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or OpenClaw).

**Prerequisites:** Docker and `docker compose`

**Uninstall:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jweingardt12/fbb-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong></summary>

#### 1. Get Yahoo API credentials

Go to [developer.yahoo.com/apps/create](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create), create an app with **Fantasy Sports** read permissions and `oob` as the redirect URI. Copy the consumer key and secret.

#### 2. Configure and run

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY and YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET
mkdir -p config data
docker compose up -d
```

The container auto-generates `config/yahoo_oauth.json` from your env vars on first start. You don't need to create this file manually.

#### 3. Find your league and team IDs

On the first API call, Yahoo will prompt you to authorize the app. Run `discover` to trigger auth and find your IDs in one step:

```bash
./yf discover
```

Follow the prompt — open the URL, log in, paste the verification code. The command then prints your current-season leagues and teams:

```
Your 469 MLB Fantasy Leagues:

  1. My League Name
     Season: 2026  |  Teams: 12
     LEAGUE_ID=469.l.12345
     TEAM_ID=469.l.12345.t.7  (My Team Name)

Add these to your .env file:

  LEAGUE_ID=469.l.12345
  TEAM_ID=469.l.12345.t.7
```

Copy the values into `.env`, then restart:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Tokens refresh automatically after the initial authorization.

#### 4. Connect to Claude

Add to your `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fbb-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "fbb-mcp", "node", "/app/mcp-apps/dist/main.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Everything runs inside Docker — no local dependencies beyond Docker itself.

</details>

### 5. Enable write operations (optional)

To let Claude make roster moves (add, drop, trade, set lineup), set `ENABLE_WRITE_OPS=true` in `.env`, rebuild with `docker compose up -d`, and set up a browser session:

```bash
./yf browser-login
```

This opens a browser — log into Yahoo manually. The session saves to `config/yahoo_session.json` and lasts 2-4 weeks.

### 6. Enable preview dashboard (optional)

To browse all UI views in your browser, set `ENABLE_PREVIEW=true` in `.env` and rebuild:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://localhost:4951/preview` (or your `MCP_SERVER_URL/preview`). The preview app lets you switch between mock and live data, toggle dark/light mode, and explore every view the MCP server can render.

## Connecting to Claude

The MCP server supports two transports: **stdio** (local, for Claude Code and Claude Desktop) and **Streamable HTTP** (remote, for Claude.ai). Both use the same tools and backend.

**Claude Code / Claude Desktop** — Add the config from [Quick Start step 4](#4-connect-to-claude) to `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) or `claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop). Config file paths for Claude Desktop:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Restart the app after saving.

### Claude.ai (remote access)

Claude.ai can't run local processes, so the MCP server needs to be reachable over the internet. You need a machine running Docker, a domain name, and a reverse proxy for HTTPS.

**1. Set env vars** in `.env`:

```bash
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.com
MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

`MCP_SERVER_URL` must match exactly what Claude.ai connects to — it's used to generate OAuth callback URLs.

**2. Set up a reverse proxy** to forward HTTPS to the container's port 4951:

<details>
<summary>Caddy (automatic HTTPS)</summary>

```
your-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:4951
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>nginx</summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4951;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
</details>

Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, and Pangolin also work.

**3. Rebuild and connect:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

In Claude.ai, go to Settings > Integrations > Add MCP Server, enter `https://your-domain.com/mcp`. You'll be redirected to a login page — enter your `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` to authorize. The token persists across sessions.

<details>
<summary>How the auth flow works</summary>

The MCP server implements MCP OAuth 2.1 using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. No third-party auth provider needed — the password is checked directly against `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD`.

```
Claude.ai → GET /mcp → 401 Unauthorized
         → discovers OAuth metadata at /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
         → redirects user to /authorize → /login (password form)
         → user enters password → /login/callback validates it
         → issues authorization code → Claude.ai exchanges for bearer token
         → GET/POST /mcp with Authorization: Bearer <token> → tools work
```
</details>

## Agent Orchestrators (OpenClaw)

Connect fbb-mcp to an agent orchestrator and your fantasy team manages itself. The agent sets optimal lineups every morning, monitors injuries, finds waiver wire pickups, scouts opponents, and identifies trade opportunities — all on autopilot with no manual interaction required.

Any AI agent orchestrator that supports MCP can use fbb-mcp (OpenClaw, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.). The setup below uses [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) as an example.

### What the Agent Does

The agent operates as an autonomous fantasy GM with a daily and weekly routine:

**Every morning (9am):**
1. Calls `yahoo_morning_briefing` — gets injuries, lineup issues, live matchup scores, category strategy, opponent moves, and top waiver targets in one call
2. Calls `yahoo_auto_lineup` — benches off-day players, starts active bench players, flags injured starters
3. Executes any critical action items (IL moves, pending trade responses)
4. Reports a 2-3 sentence summary of actions taken

**Every Monday (8am):**
1. Calls `yahoo_league_landscape` — standings, playoff projections, rival activity, trade opportunities
2. Calls `yahoo_matchup_strategy` — category-by-category game plan for this week's opponent
3. Reports your opponent, which categories to target/concede, and top recommended actions

**Midweek (Wednesday 10am):**
1. Calls `yahoo_waiver_recommendations` — ranked add/drop pairs with projected category impact
2. If a recommendation shows strong improvement, executes the top add/drop automatically

**Weekend (Saturday 9am):**
1. Calls `yahoo_roster_health_check` — audits for injured starters, IL-eligible players not on IL, bust candidates, off-day issues
2. Reports any critical or warning issues found

### Decision Tiers

The agent follows configurable rules about what it can do autonomously vs. what requires your approval:

| Tier | Actions | Agent Behavior |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Auto-execute** | Lineup optimization, IL moves | Safe and idempotent — the agent acts immediately |
| **Execute + report** | Waiver pickups, streaming adds, obvious drops | High-confidence moves — the agent acts and tells you what it did |
| **Report + wait** | Trades, dropping regular starters, large FAAB bids | The agent recommends but waits for your approval |

These tiers are defined in the agent persona file (`AGENTS.md`) and can be customized to match your comfort level.

### Setup with OpenClaw

The one-command installer handles OpenClaw configuration automatically if it detects OpenClaw on your system. To set it up manually:

**1. Ensure the Docker container is running:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**2. Copy the config files:**

```bash
cp openclaw-config.yaml /path/to/openclaw/config/
cp AGENTS.md /path/to/openclaw/config/
cp openclaw-cron-examples.json /path/to/openclaw/config/
```

**3. Edit `openclaw-config.yaml`** — the default connects via stdio through Docker:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: fantasy-gm
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    persona: ./AGENTS.md
    mcp_servers:
      - name: fbb-mcp
        command: docker
        args: [exec, -i, fbb-mcp, node, /app/mcp-apps/dist/main.js, --stdio]
        env:
          ENABLE_WRITE_OPS: "true"
    schedules: ./openclaw-cron-examples.json
```

Key configuration:
- **`persona: ./AGENTS.md`** — The agent persona teaches the agent league-specific strategy, daily/weekly routines, which workflow tools to call, and the decision tiers above. Customize this file to adjust the agent's behavior.
- **`ENABLE_WRITE_OPS: "true"`** — Required for the agent to make roster moves. Without this, the agent can only read data and report recommendations.
- **`schedules`** — Points to the cron job definitions. Edit `openclaw-cron-examples.json` to change times, timezone, or add/remove scheduled tasks.

**4. Start the agent:**

```bash
openclaw start
```

### Cron Schedule

The default schedule (all times Eastern, configurable):

| Schedule | Task | Tools Called |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Daily 9am | Lineup + briefing | `yahoo_morning_briefing` + `yahoo_auto_lineup` |
| Monday 8am | Matchup plan | `yahoo_league_landscape` + `yahoo_matchup_strategy` |
| Wednesday 10am | Waiver check | `yahoo_waiver_recommendations` |
| Saturday 9am | Roster audit | `yahoo_roster_health_check` |

Each cron job runs in an isolated session, calls the specified tools, and produces a concise report. Edit `openclaw-cron-examples.json` to customize:

```json
{
  "name": "Daily lineup + morning briefing",
  "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 9 * * *", "tz": "America/New_York" },
  "sessionTarget": "isolated",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "agentTurn",
    "message": "Daily routine. Call yahoo_morning_briefing, then yahoo_auto_lineup. Execute any priority-1 action items. Report actions taken in 2-3 sentences."
  }
}
```

### Workflow Tools

Six aggregated tools designed for autonomous agents. Each combines 5-7+ individual API calls server-side and returns concise, decision-ready output — minimizing token usage and tool call count. These tools are available to all clients (Claude Code, Claude.ai, agent orchestrators).

| Tool | Aggregates | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `yahoo_morning_briefing` | injury_report + lineup_optimize + matchup + strategy + whats_new + waiver_analyze x2 | Daily situational awareness |
| `yahoo_league_landscape` | standings + season_pace + power_rankings + league_pulse + transactions + trade_finder + scoreboard | Weekly strategic planning |
| `yahoo_roster_health_check` | injury_report + lineup_optimize + roster + intel/busts | Roster audit |
| `yahoo_waiver_recommendations` | category_check + waiver_analyze x2 + roster | Decision-ready waiver picks |
| `yahoo_auto_lineup` | injury_report + lineup_optimize (apply) | Daily lineup optimization |
| `yahoo_trade_analysis` | value + trade_eval + intel/player | Trade evaluation by name |

### Agent Persona

The `AGENTS.md` file defines the agent's identity and behavior. It includes:

- **League awareness** — On first session, the agent learns your league's format, team count, scoring categories, and roster rules
- **Strategy principles** — Target close categories, concede lost causes, stream pitchers for counting stats, monitor closer situations, trade from surplus to improve weaknesses
- **Competitive intelligence** — Track rival managers' activity, react to opponent moves, check standings implications before trades
- **Token efficiency** — Always use workflow tools over individual tools when possible, keep reports concise

You can customize `AGENTS.md` to adjust the agent's strategy, risk tolerance, or reporting style.

### Health Check

The server exposes a `GET /health` endpoint (unauthenticated) that returns `{ ok: true, writes_enabled: bool }` for monitoring uptime and verifying write operations are enabled.

./yf <command> [args]
./yf --json <command> [args]   # JSON output mode for programmatic use
./yf api <endpoint> [params]   # Direct API calls (e.g., yf api /api/rankings)
./yf api-list                  # List all available API endpoints
```

    Yahoo Fantasy API        MCP Clients (stdio/HTTP)
    Yahoo Website (browser)  ├── Claude Code / Desktop
    FanGraphs (projections)  ├── Claude.ai (remote)
    Baseball Savant (intel)  └── Agent orchestrators
                                 (OpenClaw, cron-scheduled)
```

- **Read operations**: Yahoo Fantasy OAuth API (fast, reliable)
- **Write operations**: Playwright browser automation against Yahoo Fantasy website
- **Valuations**: Consensus projections (Steamer + ZiPS + Depth Charts) auto-fetched from FanGraphs, park-factor adjusted, blended with live stats in-season (weighted by games played), z-scored against league categories, with rest-of-season tracking and projection disagreement detection
- **Intelligence**: Statcast data with SIERA (expected ERA), platoon splits, arsenal change detection, batted ball profiles, and historical comparison — all cached with configurable TTL
- **MCP Apps**: Inline HTML UIs (Preact + Tailwind + Recharts) rendered directly in Claude via `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`
- **Workflow tools**: Aggregated endpoints for autonomous agents — each combines 5-7+ API calls server-side to minimize token usage

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY` | Yes | — | Yahoo app consumer key (from developer.yahoo.com) |
| `YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET` | Yes | — | Yahoo app consumer secret |
| `LEAGUE_ID` | Yes | — | Yahoo Fantasy league key (e.g., `469.l.16960`) |
| `TEAM_ID` | Yes | — | Your team key (e.g., `469.l.16960.t.12`) |
| `ENABLE_WRITE_OPS` | No | `false` | Enable write operation tools (add, drop, trade, lineup) |
| `ENABLE_PREVIEW` | No | `false` | Serve the preview dashboard at `/preview` |
| `MCP_SERVER_URL` | For Claude.ai | — | Public HTTPS URL for remote access |
| `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` | For Claude.ai | — | Password for the OAuth login page |

The game key changes each MLB season (e.g., `469` for 2026). Run `./yf discover` to find your league and team IDs automatically.
